          <h2>Chicken</h2>
          While many people assume that this dish originated in India, the most popular origin story places its roots in Scotland when a Bengali chef had to improvise in a jiffy. Today, many consider it to be the national dish of the UK. The dish is celebrated for embracing the diverse and ancient heritage of the islands. 

          However, there is considerable debate around this topic. Due to its complex history,  widespread adoption, and variety of preparation, the dish’s exact beginnings may never be fully known.
          
          No discussion of chicken tikka masala history is complete without the story of the Ali family. On a dark and stormy Glasgow night in 1971, an off-duty bus driver stopped in at a local Indian restaurant for a plate of chicken curry. The chef, Ali Ahmed Aslam, delivered his dish, but the bus driver was displeased and returned it for being too dry.
          
          In a pinch, Ali used what he had on hand – a simmering, creamy tomato soup – to moisten the dish. The bus driver enjoyed his new plate so much that he regularly returned for years, bringing his friends and family to enjoy Ali’s new creation. Thus, chicken tikka masala was born.
          
          Of course, there are those who doubt the veracity of this tale. Some food historians claim that the dish is simply a toned-down version of similar, spicier dishes in the Punjab regions of India. They believe the dish dates back much further, possibly even originating in the 1940s.  
          
          So, while some say the dish began in Britain, it still originated from Bangladeshi chefs who devised it as a means of pleasing the milder Scottish palate.
          
          Whatever the case, nearly everyone agrees on a few key points. First, the dish involves chicken tikka (small pieces or bits of meat) and creamy tomato masala. Second, chicken tikka masala is now a delicious, worldwide favorite among the wide offerings of Indian cuisine. Indian restaurants from North America to Asia prepare it as a feature dish, and some of the world’s top chefs offer it on their menus.
